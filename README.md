# hr_analytics_kaggle

I downloaded the data from here:
https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics

This is a small exploration data set.  
The question posed is "Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? Predict who will leave next."

The data fields are:
Satisfaction Level
Last evaluation
Number of projects
Average monthly hours
Time spent at the company
Whether they have had a work accident
Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
Departments (column sales)
Salary
Whether the employee has left
